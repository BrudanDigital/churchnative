you hv to clear map using 
googlemap.clear
how ever this doesnt return the marker ids to m0 
also u hv to clear the datastructure were u store the marker event combinations
like hashmap.clear or new hashmap();

everytime onlocationchanged is called to goes and selects events from the database
and adds them as markers however google maps jst creates more marker obbjects rather than
clearing and then drawing
so u hv to do the clearing on your own
